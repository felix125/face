Dear Dr. Leshan:

I am Felix Chang, your reader from Taiwan. It's so excited for me to contact with you directly.

In order to understand how the healing work in cancer patients, I have devoted myself to visit the people who survive after this disaster. I tried to know their life story when they are suffering and experienced the treatment they shared to me, for example, qigong, yoga and so on. Because I can not get any support from the medical system. I establish a studio, Profecia Healing, to do this research individually.

At last I find the key point to heal the cancer is not the medical treatment, is the change of their philosophy of life and lifestyle. They all told me very similar conclusion, that is, the cancer is a turning point of their life.

If a treatment can lead people to start their new life, that is a good treatment even if the treatment is known useless from medical science of view.

Three month ago, a friend gave me one of your book in traditional Chinese version, cancer as turning point. I am so excited after reading the book. You not only show us how thoughts and emotion directly influence our body, but also some very useful skill to lead people to find out the individual answer of the cancer.

The book is out of print in taiwan, and have some translation mistake. But I feel it's very important to let people know their life is still full of hopes. They do not need to accept the hint they will suffer from the medical treatment and die helpless.

I asked the publisher for help to publish this book again, but they rejected. Finally, I found your homepage and your phone number. I gave you a call. From your kindly and gentle voice, I knew I am in the right way.

I hope this book can be published again, because very little people know the connection of our mind and body and they evan do not know they can survive and treat the cancer as a turning of life.

I am not belong to any publisher. I hope I can publish by myself. It is because the publisher do not focus on the value of each people, they just care about money. That is another story i will share you in the near future. I find this kind of attitude has some relationship with disease.

Could you give me the permission to translate your book into traditional chinese and publish again? Although I am not belong to any publisher, I still can publish it from my studio directly if I have your permission and register the translated one in our government.

If you agree, please tell me how to create a contract with you, include the royalty, permission years or anything else.

Best regards.

Felix Chang
